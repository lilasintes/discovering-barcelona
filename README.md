# Discovering Barcelona
I am planning on moving to Barcelona in a few months. The goal of this project is to discover the city using multiple open-source data sets. Why? First because before settling there for a few years, I want to know more about this city. Second, I want to find the best localisation to rent a flat according to my criterias.
